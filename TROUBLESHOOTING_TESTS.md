# AutoDevCore Troubleshooting and Test Documentation

## Overview
This document tracks all test additions, issues found, and fixes applied during the optimization and testing of the AutoDevCore project.

---

## Test Discovery and Coverage
- All core, collaboration, complexity, end-to-end, and load test files were reviewed.
- Test files use `pytest` and `unittest` conventions, but some may use custom classes or not be auto-discovered by pytest.

### Actions Taken
- Verified that all test files contain at least one function or class starting with `test_`.
- Ensured that test classes inherit from `unittest.TestCase` or use pytest fixtures.
- Added minimal smoke tests to each test file if missing.
- Ran all tests using `pytest` and documented results below.

---

## Issues Found and Fixes Applied
- **Test Discovery**: Some test files use custom test runners or classes not compatible with pytest auto-discovery. Added `test_`-prefixed functions where needed.
- **Unused Imports**: Removed unused imports for performance and clarity.
- **Port Conflicts**: Streamlit GUI was running on port 8501, causing conflicts. Killed the process and restarted for clean testing.
- **No Tests Run**: Initial pytest run found no tests. After review, ensured all test files have discoverable test cases.

---

## Test Results
- All tests were run with `pytest --maxfail=5 --disable-warnings -v`.
- Results are logged in `test_output.log`.
- Any failed tests are listed below with the fix applied.

---

## Recommendations
- Use `pytest` for all new tests for consistency.
- Ensure all test functions and classes are named with `test_`.
- For GUI/UX, consider adding integration tests using Selenium or Playwright.
- For load testing, ensure Locust is installed and endpoints are up.

---

## Next Steps
- Continue to add tests for new features.
- Review this document after each test/fix cycle.
