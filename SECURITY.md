## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of AutoDevCore seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Reporting Process

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to the maintainers:

1. **Email**: [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]
2. **Subject**: `[SECURITY] AutoDevCore Vulnerability Report`
3. **Encryption**: Use PGP if available

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: How this vulnerability could be exploited
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: OS, Python version, AutoDevCore version
- **Proof of Concept**: If available, include a minimal PoC
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: As quickly as possible, typically within 30 days

### Disclosure Policy

- Vulnerabilities will be disclosed via GitHub Security Advisories
- CVE numbers will be requested for significant issues
- Patches will be released as soon as possible
- Credit will be given to reporters unless they prefer anonymity

## Security Considerations

### AutoDevCore Security Features

- **Offline Operation**: No network communication by default
- **Sandboxed Plugins**: Plugin execution is isolated
- **No Sensitive Data**: No API keys or secrets stored
- **Local Models**: GPT-OSS models run locally via Ollama

### Best Practices

- Keep AutoDevCore updated to the latest version
- Use trusted plugins only
- Review generated code before deployment
- Use environment variables for any configuration
- Regularly update dependencies

### Known Limitations

- Plugin system allows arbitrary code execution
- Generated code should be reviewed for security
- GPT-OSS models may have their own security considerations
- Local file system access for output generation

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) and will be clearly marked in release notes.

## Responsible Disclosure

We appreciate security researchers who:

- Report vulnerabilities privately first
- Allow reasonable time for fixes
- Avoid exploiting vulnerabilities beyond what's necessary
- Work with us to coordinate disclosure

## Security Team

The security team consists of the project maintainers. All security reports are handled with the utmost confidentiality.

## Acknowledgments

We thank all security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to help make AutoDevCore more secure.
