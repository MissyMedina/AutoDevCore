# Product Requirements Document (PRD) — CodeForge AI

## 1. Project Overview
- **Product Name**: CodeForge AI  
- **Author / Owner**: Missy (Product Owner)  
- **Date**: August 6, 2025  
- **Status**: Draft — open for stakeholder feedback  
- **Target Release**: v1.0 Beta – Q1 2026

## 2. Business Objectives & Goals 🏆
- Enable developers and teams to automate continuous code quality improvements—offline—at commit-time.
- Reduce code defects and review friction by *50%* in early adopters.
- Increase dev velocity by generating PRDs, tests, and refactors automatically.
- Position as the go-to **Local Agent for secure dev environments**.

## 3. Background & Strategic Fit
With demand rising for secure, on-prem and local development tooling, CodeForge AI addresses a critical gap: an *agentic* dev assistant that lives in your repo, with full autonomy—no cloud required. This aligns with enterprise trends around air-gapped CI/CD, data privacy, and AI-powered DevTools adoption. Features like agent-based orchestration and automated documentation uniquely position us for partner interest from companies like GitHub, JetBrains, Atlassian.

## 4. Assumptions & Constraints
- Assumes target users have access to local GPU/CPU resources that can run an LLM at reasonable speed.
- Assumes secure environments where cloud access is restricted.
- Constraints include open‑source model licensing, repo size limits (e.g. <500 MB initially), and language support (Python, JavaScript to start).
- No real-time online connectivity, so all inference and updates occur locally.

## 5. User Personas & Use Cases
- **Persona A – Secure Enterprise DevOps Lead**  
  Wants an AI tool that audits code and refactors without sending data to the cloud. Use case: catch vulnerabilities, modernize legacy repo offline.
- **Persona B – Indie Developer**  
  Works offline, values Git‑based automation. Use case: AI generates tests, README, PRD templates locally on commit.
- **Persona C – Academic / Teaching Sandbox**  
  Learners use CodeForge AI on local repos to teach automated code improvement cycles.

## 6. Functional Requirements
| Feature Category | Requirements Description |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| **Repo Analysis Agent** | Scans codebase, builds dependency graphs, flags outdated patterns, outputs diagrams. |
| **Code Writing Agent** | Reads TODOs/issues, writes code following project style, suggests refactors with measurable improvements. |
| **Test Generation Agent** | Generates and executes unit/integration tests, reports code coverage, reruns tests automatically on changes. |
| **Documentation Agent** | Builds/upates README, PRD draft, dependency diagrams, setup guides. |
| **Agent Orchestrator** | Coordinates tasks among agents, resolves conflicts, maintains agent state in repo. |
| **CLI Integration** | Commands like `codeforge analyze`, `codeforge evolve`, `codeforge docs`; logger output; interactive mode. |

## 7. Non‑Functional Requirements (NFR)
- CLI response time: < 2s for status commands; multi-agent evolve completes within 5 minutes for repos <500kLOC.
- Test generation must achieve ≥80% coverage before auto-commit.
- CPU/GPU fallback: must be able to run on CPU-only hardware with graceful performance degradation.
- Security: no external network access; no user data leaves repository.
- Scalability: support medium-sized codebases; memory use ≤4 GB.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria & Test Plan
- **Business**:  
  - On running `codeforge evolve`, code is refactored and improvements improve a measurable metric (e.g. performance or lint score).  
  - README and PRD files are generated and commit-ready.
- **Technical**:  
  - Simulated repos instrumented with low-test-coverage code: evolve increases coverage to ≥80%.  
  - Repo analysis graphs are generated in `.svg` format.  
  - CLI behaves predictably under success and failure cases; logs exist.
- **Edge cases**: large binary files, merge conflicts, unsupported languages gracefully warn user.

## 9. Release Plan & Milestones
| Milestone | Date | Deliverable |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Functional spec approval | Sept 15, 2025 | Finalized PRD |
| Alpha release | Nov 1, 2025 | Core agents working on Python repos |
| Beta v1.0 | Jan 15, 2026 | Multi-language support + full evolve cycle |
| Public launch | Mar 1, 2026 | Documentation, packaging, onboarding scripts |

## 10. Open Questions
1. Which LLM backbone(s) should initial release support (e.g. local Llama‑based vs. other open models)?  
2. Should we plugin hook into VS Code / JetBrains or remain CLI-only for v1?  
3. What code style formats/linters to support out of the box?  
4. How will user configure coverage threshold, style rules, refactor rules?

## 11. Out of Scope (for v1)
- Cloud‑based collaboration or online APIs  
- Support for compiled languages like C++ or Rust initially  
- Real-time IDE plugins  
- GUI dashboards or visualization UIs beyond generated files  
- Detailed personalization / fine‑tuning on user's code style  

## 12. Future Roadmap (Beyond v1)
- **Plugin versions**: IDE integration (VSCode, JetBrains).  
- **Network mode**: LAN‑based agent collaboration (LAN Forge).  
- **Model personalization**: fine‑tune on team style and historical commits.  
- **Full CI/CD integration**: local pipelines, auto‑merge bots.
