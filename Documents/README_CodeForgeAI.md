## 🧠 Motivation
Many teams need powerful AI tooling but can’t rely on cloud services. CodeForge AI fills that gap by offering an agentic, **offline-first** solution to continuously evolve your codebase. It automates the code→test→doc cycle in a secure, self‑hosting model ideal for enterprises, open‑source projects, and indie developers alike.

## ✨ Features
- **Repo Analysis Agent**: learns project layout, dependency graph, flags outdated patterns.
- **Code Agent**: writes features, refactors code to match standards, respects TODOs and style.
- **Test Agent**: auto‑generates and executes tests, enforces ≥80% coverage threshold.
- **Documentation Agent**: updates README, PRD drafts, diagrams, and onboarding guides.
- **Orchestrator Agent**: coordinates agents, handles merge conflicts, rolls back on failure.
- **CLI Interface**: intuitive commands like `codeforge analyze`, `evolve`, `docs`.
