### **Part 1: Core AI Generation (1.5 minutes)**

```
ðŸŽ¬ SCENE 2: AI-POWERED CODE GENERATION

"Let's start with the core feature - AI-powered code generation. I'll generate a complete task management system from a simple description."

[Type in terminal:]
python cli.py --mode generate --idea "Task management system with user authentication and real-time updates" --complexity medium --framework fastapi

"Watch as AutoDevCore analyzes the idea, creates a detailed application plan, and generates a complete codebase with security features, database models, API endpoints, and frontend templates."
```

**Visual:** Show the generation process, highlight the generated files

```
"Notice how AutoDevCore automatically includes:
- JWT authentication system
- Database models and migrations
- RESTful API endpoints
- Security middleware

### **Part 2: Multi-Model AI Integration (1 minute)**

```
ðŸŽ¬ SCENE 3: INTELLIGENT AI ORCHESTRATION

"AutoDevCore doesn't rely on just one AI model. It intelligently selects the best model for each task using our Multi-Model AI system."

[Show the AI orchestrator:]
python -c "
from plugins.ai_orchestrator import AIOrchestrator
orchestrator = AIOrchestrator()
print('ðŸ¤– AI Models Available:')
print('- OpenAI GPT-4 for complex reasoning')
print('- Anthropic Claude for code generation')
print('- GPT-OSS for local/offline operations')
print('- Intelligent fallbacks for reliability')
"

"Each AI model is optimized for specific tasks, ensuring the best results while maintaining reliability through intelligent fallbacks."
```

---

### **Part 3: Real-Time Collaboration (1 minute)**

```
ðŸŽ¬ SCENE 4: TEAM COLLABORATION

"Now let's see how teams can collaborate in real-time using AutoDevCore's collaboration platform."

[Start collaboration demo:]
python -c "
from plugins.collaboration_platform import CollaborationPlatform
cp = CollaborationPlatform()
project = cp.create_collaborative_project('Team Project', 'Collaborative development workspace', 'demo@example.com')
print(f'ðŸ‘¥ Created collaborative workspace: {project}')
"

"Teams can:
- Edit code in real-time
- See each other's cursors
- Chat while coding
- Share files and resources
- Track project progress
- Manage permissions and roles"
```

**Visual:** Show the collaboration interface (if available)

---

### **Part 4: Plugin Ecosystem (1 minute)**

```
ðŸŽ¬ SCENE 5: EXTENSIBLE PLUGIN SYSTEM

"AutoDevCore's plugin system allows unlimited customization and extension."

[Show plugin system:]
python -c "
from plugins.plugin_manager import PluginManager
pm = PluginManager()
plugins = pm.list_plugins()
print('ðŸ”Œ Available Plugins:')
for plugin in plugins:
    print(f'- {plugin.name}: {plugin.description}')
"

"Developers can:
- Install pre-built plugins
- Create custom plugins
- Share plugins with the community
- Extend functionality without limits"
```

---

### **Part 5: Performance & Security (1 minute)**

```
ðŸŽ¬ SCENE 6: ENTERPRISE-GRADE FEATURES

"AutoDevCore includes enterprise-grade performance optimization and security auditing."

[Run performance audit:]
python plugins/performance_optimizer.py

[Run security audit:]
python plugins/security_auditor.py

"Performance Features:
- Redis caching for 60-80% faster responses
- Database optimization and indexing
- Load testing with 2,974 RPS capability
- Real-time monitoring and alerting

Security Features:
- OWASP Top 10 compliance
- Comprehensive vulnerability scanning
- Input validation and sanitization
- JWT authentication and authorization"
```

---

### **Part 6: Generated Application Demo (1 minute)**

```
ðŸŽ¬ SCENE 7: RUNNING THE GENERATED APP

"Let's run the application we just generated and see it in action."

[Run the generated app:]
cd output/task-management-system
python main.py

[Open browser to http://localhost:8000]

"Here's our fully functional task management system with:
- User registration and login
- Task creation and management
- Real-time updates
- RESTful API documentation
